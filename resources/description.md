#Features

Quality modules inspired by FFF-375, but very janky!

* Quality modules as items. Can't be placed directly in machines. Use module to select around relevant machines to insert, right click to remove.
* Various crafting machine variations with baked in quality modules. Assemblers can craft these baked machines from base machine and modules.
* Quality upgrades for many items, inspired by the FFF.
* Recycling according to FFF.

#Compatibility

* Vanilla
* Wasn't tested and probably won't work with any overhauls

#Settings

* Show programming baked machines from base and module on player - Unneeded with selection tool.
* Enabled/disable additional quality bonuses not in the FFF - reasonable upgrades like lamp range.

#Modding interface

This mod has a modding interface, for simple addition of new quality bonuses. See source code page for more details. 

#Known issues

* Researching all technologies (/cheat) takes time
* Quality graphics do not appear on ghosts or GUIs

#Future plans

* More quality bonuses (missing bonuses for ammo and land mines)
