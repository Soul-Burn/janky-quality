# Features

Quality modules inspired by FFF-375, but very janky!

* Quality modules as items. Can't be placed directly in machines. Use module to drag around relevant machines to insert, right click drag to remove.
* Various crafting machine variations with baked-in quality modules. For use with bots, assemblers can craft these from base machine and modules.
* Quality upgrades for many items, inspired by the FFF.
* Recycling according to FFF.

# Compatibility

* Vanilla
* Wasn't tested and probably won't work with any overhauls

# Settings

* Show programming baked machines from base and module on player - Unneeded with selection tool.
* Enabled/disable additional quality bonuses not in the FFF - reasonable upgrades like lamp range.

# Modding interface

This mod has a modding interface, for simple addition of new quality bonuses. See source code page for more details. 

# Known issues

* Researching all technologies (/cheat) is slow
* Quality indicators do not appear on ghosts or GUIs
* Some quality indicators look strange on recipes and equipment

# Future plans

* More SA quality bonuses (some capsules)
* More extra non-SA quality bonuses (vehicle speed, tile speed)
